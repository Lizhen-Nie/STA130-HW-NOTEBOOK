    "\n",
    "The scatter plot (Crop Yield vs. Amount of Fertilizer) may show a curvilinear or nonlinear relationship. For example, crop yield might increase at a decreasing rate after a certain point or plateau. If a straight trendline does not align well with the data points, this violates the linearity assumption.\n",

    "2)Heteroscedasticity (Variance of Residuals is Non-constant):\n",
    "\n",
    "If the residuals' histogram or scatter plot shows increasing or decreasing variance as the fertilizer amount increases, this violates homoscedasticity.\n",
    "This can be visualized if the spread of residuals is not uniform across the range of the independent variable.\n",
    "3)Non-Normal Residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals' histogram could deviate from a bell curve, indicating non-normality.\n",
    "A Shapiro-Wilk test or Q-Q plot can further confirm this.\n",
    "4)Outliers or Influential Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data appears to have some extreme outliers (e.g., the sharp jump in yield for specific values of fertilizer). These points could disproportionately affect the regression coefficients, leading to misleading results.\n"

Within the context of only short wait times, is there evidence in the data for a relationship between duration and wait time in the same manner as in the full data set?

    "11. Since we've considered wait times of around <64 \"short\" and wait times of >71 \"long\", let's instead just divide the data and insead call wait times of <68 \"short\" and otherwise just call them \"long\". Consider the Simple Linear Regression model specification using an indicator variable of the wait time length. Where we use ki (rather than xi) (to refer to the \"kind\" or \"katagory\" or \"kontrast\") column (that you may have noticed was already a part) of the original dataset; and, explain the \"big picture\" differences between this model specification and the previously considered model specifications\n",
    "Load the data: Ensure that old_faithful is loaded into your workspace. If it’s a CSV or another format, load it using pandas.\n",

    "Fit the regression model: Use statsmodels to run a regression where duration is the dependent variable, and C(kind, Treatment(reference=\"short\")) is the independent variable. The reference category should be \"short\".\n",

    "Hypothesis test: Look at the regression summary to analyze the p-value for the coefficient of kind. This tells you whether there's evidence against the null hypothesis of \"no difference between the groups on average.\"\n",

    "I will implement this for you now. Let me know if you have the old_faithful dataset or need help generating it!\n",

    "There was an issue displaying the regression summary directly because it was not in a compatible format for export. Let me extract the regression coefficients into a proper dataframe for display and ensure the boxplot is generated correctly. Hold on! ​​\n",

    "It seems the necessary dependency for rendering the boxplot as a static image (kaleido) is not installed in this environment. I will provide the correct analysis in a way that avoids this limitation while ensuring you can interpret both the regression results and visualization.\n",
