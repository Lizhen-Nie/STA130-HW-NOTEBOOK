    "1. The \"first pre-lecture video\" (above) describes hypothesis testing as addressing \"an idea that can be tested\", and the end of the video then discusses what our actual intended purpose in setting up a null hypothesis is. What is the key factor that makes the difference between ideas that can, and cannot be examined and tested statistically? What would you describe is the key \"criteria\" defining what a good null hypothesis is? And what is the difference between a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis in the context of hypothesis testing? Answer these questions with concise explanations in your own words.\n",
    "1)Key Factor for Testable Ideas:\n",
    "An idea can be tested statistically if it is quantifiable and measurable. It must involve variables that can be observed, collected, and analyzed objectively through data.\n",

    "2)Criteria for a Good Null Hypothesis:\n",

    "Difference Between Null and Alternative Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): Assumes there is no effect, relationship, or difference in the population. It reflects the status quo or baseline expectation.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ or Ha): Posits that there is an effect, relationship, or difference. It is what the researcher aims to support if evidence from data rejects the null hypothesis.\n",
    "In essence, the null hypothesis is what we test to either reject or fail to reject, while the alternative hypothesis represents the outcome we believe might be true."

    "6. Can a smaller p-value definitively prove that the null hypothesis is false? Is it possible to definitively prove that Fido (from the \"second pre-lecture video\") is innocent using a p-value?

    "1)No, a small p-value does not definitively prove the null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ) is false. It only indicates that the observed data would be highly unlikely if the null hypothesis were true, leading us to reject H‚ÇÄ. However, statistical testing deals with probabilities and uncertainty, so we can‚Äôt achieve absolute proof‚Äîonly strong evidence against the null.\n",

    "3)No, even a very small p-value cannot definitively prove guilt. It just shows that the observed result is unlikely under the assumption of innocence (H‚ÇÄ).
